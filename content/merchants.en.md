### Accept Vertcoin for your business

You can either accept Vertcoin via a payment processor that accepts cryptocurrency and give you your local currency, or by integrating the Vertcoin wallet into your payment system. Vertcoin is almost a drop-in replacement for Bitcoin so if you already support Bitcoin, Vertcoin should be trivial to support. 

#### Payment gateways

Payment gateways accept Vertcoin on your behalf and give you your national currency in return. [CoinPayments](https://www.coinpayments.net/) is currently the preferred method of accepting Vertcoin for your online business. CoinPayments charged an 0.5% fee for its services and has integrations with various popular [e-commerce platforms](https://www.coinpayments.net/merchant-tools-plugins) including WooCommerce, Xcart, drupal and wordpress.

#### For developers

Vertcoin is compatible with most exiting libraries intended for Bitcoin such as [bitcoinjs-lib](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib) and [python-bitcoinlib](https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib). Vertcoin also has ports of [Bitcore](https://github.com/Cubey2019/vertcore), [Insight](https://insight.vertcoin.org) and [Electrum](https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx).
