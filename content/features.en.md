## Dedication to Decentralisation

Vertcoin is committed to keeping the coin and system as dectrentralised as possible. In the height of the crypto gold rush it seems that coins no longer care about decentralisation. It seems everything has turned into a massive money making scheme. Without decentralisation of consensus tokens are worthless, you're buying a section on a database. Decentralisation is why we're all here, to create a system for the people of the world to be proud of.

## Lightning Network - Mobile Enabled

Mobile Lightning "Always On" is the holy grail of Lightning Network implementations. Vertcoin will be the first to implement a true mobile compatible Lightning Network available to use for any business or consumer. This will be done with LIT, MIT-DCI's implementation of Lightning Network, created by Thadeus Dryja the author of the original lightning network whitepaper. LIT will stay true to the values of the whitepaper, it will never be monetised. It will complete the dream of being a true scaling solution for all segwit coins and other coins in the future. LIT supports all segwit coins natively unlike it's sibling developments, this means adding coins to LIT is very quick and easy.


## LIT Lightning Ecosystem For Segwit Coins


## Lightning Atomic Swaps

Atomic Swaps will allow coin agnostic payments, this allows merchants to accept payment in one currency while using a liquidity network to instantly accept the currency of their choice. This would be like paying for a Coffee in USD and the merchant receiving GBP. As mentioned previously; the LIT Lightning Network will natively support segwit coins to start with, the Vertcoin Lightning Ecosystem powered by LIT will support all these currencies to start with, enabling them to be spent and accepted at merchants all around the world natively.

## Stealth Addresses

Stealth addresses work by generating a separate substitute addresses that you can give out publicly. If someone were to look up this addresses they wouldn't be able to see your balance or transactions as the addresses is just a substitute for your own, not the real addresses. The Lightning Network also gives similar levels of anonymity through substitute addresses so stealth addresses will be implemented as a later solution on top on Lightning Network.


## Publically Mineable (ASIC Resistant)

Vertcoin believes in consensus that is decentralised as possible, otherwise coins do not have any value. Proof-Of-Work has an innate problem as specialised mining machines were created that far outweigh the efficiency of normal graphics cards. This leads to a massive disproportion in consensus to monopolies that create ASICs.

## Lightning Network - All 4 Networks

Vertcoin believes in free choice, we will be creating the necessary fork upgrades by mid year to support all of the other Lightning Networks. Users will have the choice to use whichever Lightning Network they wish.
