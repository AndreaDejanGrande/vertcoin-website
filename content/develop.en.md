### Contribute to Vertcoin's development

Vertcoin is supported entirely by volunteers and community donations. Whether it
be through programming for one of our free software projects, marketing, help and
support or financial donations, there is a way for anyone to contribute to VTC. 
Vertcoin had no pre-mine, ICO or air-drop and has been fairly distributed via its
since decentalized mining network since its inception in 2014. We appreciate any
contribution big or small and are willing to help people with the required skills 
get up to speed so please don't hesitate to reach out. 

#### Our projects

This is a list of the projects currently being lead by the Vertcoin development team that are under active development. 

|Project|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|[One-Click Miner](https://github.com/vertcoin/One-Click-Miner)|Lead by Joe, a member of the development team, the One-Click Miner (OCM) aims to provide an all-in-one graphical mining dashboard for Vertcoin. The OCM is written in VB.NET and runs on Windows.|
|[Vertcoin Core](https://github.com/vertcoin/vertcoin)|Vertcoin Core is the reference client for the Vertcoin Network and forms the primary Vertcoin wallet. Core is derived from upstream [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and aims to keep pace with upstream revisions, modified for Vertcoin-specific features. Vertcoin Core is written with C++ and Qt.|
|[Electrum-VTC](https://github.com/vertcoin/electrum-vtc)|Electrum-VTC is a Vertcoin fork of upstream [Electrum](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum) that provides a [Simple Payment Verification](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification) (SPV) wallet that does not require you to download the entire blockchain. There is also a TOR-only version of Electrum-VTC for private transaction broadcasting. Electrum-VTC is written in Python.|
|[blkidx](https://github.com/gertjaap/blockchain-indexer)|Due to the lack of performance and that lack of support for new Bitcoin features in existing blockchain index/API servers, we wrote our own from scratch. Lead by Gert-Jaap, the indexer is the fastest known to sync and runs with the smallest resource footprint. The indexer is written in C++ and synchronizes Bitcoin, Litecoin and Vertcoin.|
|[vertminer](https://github.com/vertcoin/vertminer-nvidia)|Vertminer is an optimized version of [ccminer](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer) for Lyra2REv2 (Vertcoin's custom mining algorithm). Vertminer is developed by our in-house miner developer, Alex. Using Vertminer supports Vertcoin's development by donating a small portion of your mining profits to the development team.|
|[VertDocs](https://github.com/Bryangoodson/VertDocs)|VertDocs is our open-source documentation repository hosted at [https://docs.vertcoin.org](https://docs.vertcoin.org). VertDocs development is lead by Bryan and new contributions can be made by submitting a pull request on the GitHub repository. VertDocs uses [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the documentation and the content is written in Markdown.|
|[Vertcoin-box](https://github.com/gertjaap/vertcoin-box)|Forming the backend of our upcoming multiwallet platform for [Lightning Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network) (LN) coins, "vertcoin-box" is a series of Docker containers for running a full LN stack on a raspberry pi. Similarly to your Internet router, the "vertbox" will provide round-the-clock storage and remote access for your coins on mobile devices, allowing you to send and receive with LN when away from home. The administration panel is written in Node.js.| 

#### Projects we contribute to

These are projects that are lead by entities external to the Vertcoin development team but that we contribute to regularly.

|Project|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|[Lit](https://github.com/mit-dci/lit)|Lit is the non-commercial Lightning Network implementation developed by Thaddeus Dryja, one of the original LN paper authors at the [MIT Digital Currency Intiative](https://dci.mit.edu). Lit is the primary LN implementation currently used on Vertcoin and has been integrated with our custom blockchain indexer. Lit is written in Golang.|

#### Donate

Vertcoin relies on donations to pay for servers, exchange listing fees, bounties for external development. Your generous donations make the Vertcoin project possible without a large stack of ICO or pre-mined funds due to our fair distribution via the mining network.
