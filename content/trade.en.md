### Trade Vertcoin

Vertcoin trades 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, globally with millions of 
United States Dollars worth of daily trading volume. You can trade Vertcoin for 
other cryptocurrencies or for your national currency using an exchange. Brokers 
provide trading options that do not require an account for a worse rate and 
higher fee. It is also possible to meet up in-person and trade using your
preferred method of transfer. Finally, those who are confident with the command
line can on-chain atomic swap (trustless exchange without a third party) for a 
handful of other cryptocurrencies. 


#### Exchanges

Exchanges are where you trade with other people. A traditional market order book
is maintained that matches buyers and sellers who wish to trade at the same price.
The exchange maintains custody of your coins whilst they are being used on the 
exchange. Exchanges have by far the most liquidity and the best rates. However,
all exchanges will require accounts and some level of personal verification before
you are allowed to trade.

#### Brokers

Brokers buy and sell Vertcoin from you directly. Some do not require a user account
to trade but will charge you a premium for the convenience in both a worse rate and
higher fees. Those who carry national currency trading pairs will allow you to purchase
or sell coins using bank transfer or credit/debit card.
