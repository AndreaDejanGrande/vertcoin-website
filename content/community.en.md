Vertcoin did not have an ICO or Premine, the developers work entirely from community donations. We are constly looking for more people to help out and build Vertcoin. Below we have listed some ways that you can help out the Vertcoin Community, whether that be accepting Vertcoin as a business or develop code for next-generation applications, everyone can help out.

# Add Vertcoin as Payment
If you are a store owner, you can accept VTC in your store and help adoption of our currency.
# Donate
You can donate VTC to one of our donation goals and help us with funds we can put to use towards Vertcoin's future
# Translate Content
If you are native speaker of a language that our upcoming website is not (yet) translated in you can help us by translating it to your native language and make our website reach out to your native audience.
# Run a Full Node
Improve our networkâ€™s resilience. If you have a spare computer or RaspberryPi lying around, run a full node.
# Programming
If you're capable of programming in either C++, Go, VB.Net, NodeJS, or Android (Java) / iOS (Obj-C / Swift) you can contribute to any of our repositories. Our new website will have an extensive list of the projects that are important to Vertcoin's success. These are not only located on the vertcoin Github, but some are also part of the MIT-DCI - but since they're open source you're free to contribute there too and aid our chance at a successful future.
# Graphic Design
If you're handy with graphics/photoshop/web design you can reach out to our marketing team and they can use your help with all sorts of marketing materials. We can always use an extra set of hands. Not necessarily as a marketing team member, but for one-off design assignments they can always use help.
